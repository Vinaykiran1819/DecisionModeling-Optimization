# Investing in Stocks - Modern Portfolio Theory

This project focuses on Investing in Stocks and Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) for Investment and Portfolio Management. The primary goal was to develop and implement an MPT optimization model to select the optimal stock allocations from a set of 9 S&P 500 stocks across multiple sectors. This approach aims to balance risk and return, ensuring portfolio diversification.

The model led to an expected 16.81% return over the course of one year, with a 19.2% probability of loss at a 0.0002 risk level. Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate various rebalancing strategies, such as daily, weekly, and monthly rebalancing, to assess how frequently the portfolio should be adjusted for optimal performance. This project is a practical application of portfolio management techniques, showcasing how to make informed investment decisions based on risk-adjusted returns.
